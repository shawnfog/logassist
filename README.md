Log Analyzer Assistant
The MainGUI.java file contains all code necessary to run a program that allows you to choose a text based log file and display it's contents within the application. The end goal is to have a list of buttons that when clicked, will automatically parse through the selected log file and display only the relevant lines using the logic triggered by the selected button. This application could aid technical support analysts with quickly identifying important information in logs to help troubleshoot issues.
